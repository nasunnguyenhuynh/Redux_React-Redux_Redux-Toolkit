# Redux_React-Redux_Redux-Toolkit
>>> Features:
        + Shared state between components (not have to get by sequence)
        + Controlled re-render component (improved than Context-Hook)
>>> Concepts: View, Action, State
>>> Original: 
    + Create Store
    + Create Reducers (rootReducer: to use many reducers)
    + Create Actions (types: to list all types of action), 
    + Redux-thunk: 
        1. fetch APIs (talk to redux wating for fetching process), 
        2. handle fetching process (pending, fulfilled, rejected)
>>> Examples:
    + redux: using JavaScript
    + redux-toolkit (Slice is combined by types, actions, reducers): using TypeScript
