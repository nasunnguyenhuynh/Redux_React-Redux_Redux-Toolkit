# Redux_React-Redux_Redux-Toolkit
**Features:**
+ Shared state between components (not have to get by sequence)</br>
+ Controlled re-render component (improved than Context-Hook)</br>

**Concepts**: View, Action, State
  
**Original:** 
+ Create Store
+ Create Reducers (rootReducer: to use many reducers)
+ Create Actions (types: to list all types of action), 
+ Redux-thunk: 
  1. fetch APIs (talk to redux wating for fetching process),
  2. handle fetching process (pending, fulfilled, rejected)
        
**Examples:**
+ redux: using JavaScript</br>
+ redux-toolkit (Slice is combined by types, actions, reducers): using TypeScript
